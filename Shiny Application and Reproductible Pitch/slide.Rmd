```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Shiny Application

The application is a displayer of normal distribution with user's mean and standard deviation input.

## How to use ?

 * Go to the application website
 * Use the sliders to define the mean, standard deviation and window of the x-axis
 * Look at the bell-curves moving in front of your eyes !
 
## Example

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
x = seq(-5, 5, by=0.1)
y = dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)
plot(x, y, type="l")
```

## Thanks !
